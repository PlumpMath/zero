== Unit Tests ==

Zero has the beginnings of a *very* crude test suite. To run it, set up 
your environment as described in `building.txt`, and execute `make 
check`. The machinery for this is all defined in `kernel/port/main.mk`, 
and the tests run in userspace on the host (The test are therefore 
restricted to things that are machine-independent, and can run fine in 
userspace). tests are defined in files called `test_*.c`
