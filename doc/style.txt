== Coding Style ==

Rule #1: do what the rest of the code does. Below are some conventions we've adopted.

=== Whitespace and indentation ===

* Tabs for indentation
* set your tabstop to 4
* 78 columns max.

=== Naming conventions ===

* types are CapitalizedCameCase
* structs are typedefed:

	typedef struct TypeName TypeName
	struct TypeName{
		...
	};

* variables are lower_case_with_undesrcores

=== Headers ===

* Header guards in every header file.
  * if your header file is at foo/bar/baz.h in the tree, it should look like:

	#ifndef FOO_BAR_BAZ_H
	#define FOO_BAR_BAZ_H
	...
	#endif
