== Building ==

If you're building for x86, on x86 (or on amd64) it should be sufficient to do:

	export ARCH=x86
	cd kernel
	make

for the lemote yeloong port, the process is similar, except that the value for
ARCH is mips64el. In general, set ARCH to the architecture specific directory
for your platform.

If you intend to build for mips, you should have a compiler and linker in your
path called mips64el-gcc, and mips64el-ld. This is a bit sloppy, I plan to
clean this up a bit in the future. No C library support is necessary.

Note that you cannot build anything via the makefiles in subdirectories of
kernel.
