== Building ==

Short version:

	./configure --platform=...
	make

Where ... is one of panda, rpi, x86, yeeloong.

You need to have a cross-toolchain to build zero, even if you're
building on the same CPU architecture. The toolchain should be
freestanding; you want to avoid linking against host libraries.

The configure script's options --tool-prefix and --tool-suffix can be
used to override the prefix/suffix of the toolchain; use this if the
configure script isn't guessing yours correctly. (This is likely; it
isn't being terribly smart about it).

Additionally, configure respects environment variables like CC, LD,
OBJCOPY...

Out of tree builds are supported as well, and are recommended:

	mkdir ../zero-build
	cd ../zero-build
	../zero/configure --platform=...
	make

Please note that building within a subdirectory is *not* supported, and
it is very likely that doing this will go badly for you.
