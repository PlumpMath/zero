Title: A way to include headers for portable interfaces that are
 implemented per-arch.

# Description

Right now the x86 mutex implementation is all in headers, as static inline functions.
This means we can't just have different .c files for each arch, so we need a way to
directy the compiler to include the right file regardless of architecture.

This is probably going to involve refactoring the build system and/or shuffling some
files around.

# Resolution

Instead of simply doing -I $(srcdir), put an include/ directory in each of
the platform directories, as well as port/. portable interfaces with
per-platform implementations can be in ${platform}/include/kernel//arch/*.h,
which gets included as (e.g.):

	#include <kernel/arch/lock.h>
