Title: Build system does not account for dependencies on headers

# Description

This hasn't been much of a problem so far, but now that we've put a few
non-trivial things in headers (in particular, kernel/x86/lock.h), this
is going to be a bit more dangerous.

We can use the preprocessor's -M option to generate proper dependencies.

# Resolution

Use preprocessor's -M to generate .deps.mk files
