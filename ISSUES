## kernel/x86/text_console.[ch] is not thread-safe

The cursor position is in a pair of shared global variables, and there's no
syncronization on them. If multiple threads are using this module, unexpected
results may occur.

In the simple demo where you have two threads using it as stdout, you seem to
get occasional extra spaces/newlines between their output, which makes some
sense.

## Interrupt driven serial driver on x86

kernel/x86/serial.c is a polling-based serial driver. It would be nice to do
something interrupt driven, especially now that we have a basic preemptive
scheduler.
